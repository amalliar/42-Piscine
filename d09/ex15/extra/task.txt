> Create a function ft_fight which fakes the battle.

> Here is how it should be prototyped:

	void	ft_fight(t_perso *attacker, t_perso *defense, float damage);

> The first argument is the attacker, the second represents the defense.

> If the attack is a judo kick, the attacked loses 15 points.

> If the attack is a judo punch, the attacked loses 5 points.

> If the attack is a judo headbutt, the attacked loses 20 points.

> Each attack should display the output of type "Donnie Matrix does a judo kick
  on Frau Farbissina."

> Donnie and Frau are of type t_perso, as we've seen earlier today.

> The different attacks are a "judo kick", a "judo punch" and a "judo headbutt".

> Once the defense loses all their points, the function will display "Frau
  Farbissina is dead." (Frau Farbissina to be replaced by the appropriate
  defense's name.)

> There can't be a fight if both fighters have no points left.

> Each display must be followed by a line break.

> Here's an example of main, and it's output:
